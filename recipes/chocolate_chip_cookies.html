    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Among the most popular of all cookie types, the chocolate chip cookie's invention was a happy accident. In 1930, Ruth Graves Wakefield, who ran the Toll House Inn in Whitman, Massachusetts, ran out of baker's chocolate and substituted for it with pieces of Nestle's® semi-sweet chocolate. The rest is history. Chocolate chip cookies are drop cookies that can be soft and doughy or crisp and crunchy depending on how long you cook them or what ingredients you use.</p>
